# Changelog

Notable changes to Solveig, newest first. Nothing is released yet, so everything
below is under `0.0.1` and the syntax is still moving.

Each entry names the commit it landed in. Dates are the day the work was done.
What is still outstanding is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Unreleased — 0.0.1

### Array literals — `pending`, 2026-08-19

```
xs := [#1, #2, #3].
n := [[#1, #2], [#3]].
e := [].
```

`[...]` is sugar for `array:of(...)` in the strict sense: the two forms compile
to byte-identical `.sob` files, and a test asserts it rather than trusting the
claim. Two lexer tokens and one compiler branch — no new opcode, no verifier
change, nothing the VM has to learn.

Because the desugaring is real rather than a lookalike, the `array` it sends to
is the ordinary global; rebinding that name moves both spellings together. They
cannot drift apart, which is the point.

A literal is a construction, not a pooled constant, so every evaluation answers a
fresh array — two calls to a method containing one do not share it. Capped at 255
elements by `OP_SEND`'s one-byte argument count.

### The project is named Solveig — `7db2b27`, 2026-08-19

The repository had no name distinct from its parts: "Solum" was serving as the
project, the virtual machine, and the language at once.

**Solveig** now names the project. The language stays **Solum**, and the programs
stay **Solas**, **SolVM**, and **Solis**. Old Norse *Sólveig*, from *sól* "sun"
and *veig*, usually read as "strength" -- the Norse cousin of the *sol-* root the
rest of the family already shares. The README carries the longer note, including
why *SolVM* and *solum* are the same word: classical Latin wrote V where we now
write U, so Roman inscriptions give SOLVM.

Documentation only. No code, no file names, and no behaviour changed.

### Arrays — `1d8c573`, 2026-08-19

Nothing in the language could hold more than one value, so no program could
accumulate a result.

```
a := array:of(#10, #20, #30).
a:at(#1):print.              ; #10 -- indices are one-based

b := array:new.
b:add(#1):add(#2):add(#3).   ; add answers the array, so it chains
b:do({ e | sum := sum:add(e) }).
```

- A `SolArray` heap type joins the collector, and **every element is a tracing
  edge** — the reason arrays were built before strings, whose bytes are not.
- One-based indices: an index is an ordinal, not an offset. `at(#0)` is out of
  bounds and therefore caught rather than silently off by one.
- Strictness carried through: an index must be an integer, and out of range is an
  error rather than nil.
- Arrays are references, like objects. `equals` is identity; comparing contents
  is a different question and will get its own name.
- `do` bounds the count once and re-reads the backing store each pass, since the
  block may grow the array and move the store underneath it.
- Printing is depth-limited, because `a:add(a)` is legal.
- No `.sob` change: an array is built at run time, never pooled as a constant.

Still to come: the `[...]` literal sugar, and `collect`/`select`.

### Roadmap audit — `470c6d3`, 2026-08-18

No code change. Audited the roadmap against the source and against everything
raised in review, and added the two real gaps it was missing:

- **Recursion is limited to about 30 levels** (3.5). `SOL_FRAMES_MAX` is 64 and
  each recursion level costs two frames in the idiomatic form -- the method's
  block, and the `ifElse` branch block carrying the recursive call. Measured: 30
  succeeds, 31 reports "call depth exceeded". Low enough for ordinary code to
  hit.
- **A caller-owned chunk must outlive blocks defined in it** (3.6). Freeing one
  while a reachable block points into it leaves that block undefined to call. The
  collector is safe -- a block caches its owning cell, so tracing never touches a
  freed chunk -- but nothing detects the call.

Also corrected a comment in the compiler claiming there were no blocks yet.

### The collector owns compiled code — `104a5e0`, 2026-08-18

Solis no longer retains every line's chunk. Over 60,000 REPL lines, peak resident
set went from **25.5 MB growing linearly to 1.9 MB flat**.

Ownership is dual rather than wholesale, because Solas has no VM to own a chunk
on its behalf. A chunk from `sol_chunk_init` is caller-owned and freed by hand;
one from `sol_code_new` belongs to a `SolCode` cell the collector sweeps.
`sol_chunk_add_method` propagates ownership as each subtree is added, so a caller
cannot forget to.

- Added `sol_gc_push_temp` / `sol_gc_pop_temp` for cells held only in a C local
  across an allocation. Solis uses them to protect a fresh code cell while it
  compiles into it.
- A chunk's constants are traced, since they will hold heap values as soon as
  strings exist.
- A block caches its owning cell rather than reading it back through
  `block->code->chunk`. A caller-owned chunk can be freed while blocks pointing
  into it are still on the heap — calling such a block was always wrong, but the
  tracer must not fault merely for walking past one. Stress mode under ASan found
  this as a use-after-free in `mark_code`.

### A garbage collector — `29d011a`, 2026-08-18

Mark–sweep, non-moving, stop-the-world. Objects and blocks are reclaimed while a
program runs; before this nothing was freed until the VM exited.

The motivating case — a block literal allocated once per loop iteration — over
two million allocations:

| | Peak RSS |
| --- | --- |
| before | 98 MB, growing linearly |
| after | 1.5 MB, flat |

- Both heap types now begin with a shared `SolGCHeader`, so one list threads the
  whole heap and one sweep loop walks it. A new heap type joins by embedding the
  header rather than adding another list.
- Marking uses an explicit worklist, not recursion, so a graph deeper than the C
  stack traces without overflowing it — a 200,000-link proto chain is a test.
- Collection happens *before* an allocation, so the new cell cannot be swept.
  `sol_vm_init` nulls the roots before its first allocation for the same reason.
- `SOLUM_GC_STRESS=1` collects on every allocation. The whole suite passes under
  it with ASan and UBSan.

Code is still owned by the chunk that compiled it, so Solis continues to retain
every line's chunk; that is roadmap 1.1b.

### `:=` became one operator — `7029d27`, 2026-08-18

**Breaking: method definitions changed shape, and `.sob` went to version 4.**

`:=` used to mean two different things depending on what stood to its left. In
`a := #45:add(#32)` it evaluated the right-hand side; in
`integer:fun() := #45:add(#32)` it did not — that was a definition form the
compiler pattern-matched, whose right-hand side was compiled to run later,
freshly, on every call.

Now there is one rule: `obj:name := value` evaluates and binds, exactly as
`a := value` does.

```
integer:double := { self:mul(#2) }.
integer:poly := { a, b | self:mul(a):add(b) }.
integer:quadruple := { | d | d := self:double. d:double }.
```

- A slot holds a value. A slot holding a **block** is a method: sending its name
  runs the block with the receiver as `self`. A slot holding anything else
  answers that value, so methods and data slots are no longer different kinds of
  thing.
- Because `:=` evaluates, a method can be **computed**:
  `integer:double := maker:value()`.
- Blocks gained parameters: `{ a, b | ... }`. A leading `|` still means
  temporaries.
- Capture now **chains**. With no separate notion of a method, every frame is a
  block's, so `OP_OUTER` carries a depth and the runtime walks the lexical chain,
  checking liveness at each hop.
- `self` is no longer resolved lexically at compile time — which block ends up
  invoked as a method is not knowable there. It compiles to slot 0 of the frame
  being entered; the VM captures the receiver into a block at creation, and a
  send to a slot holding it overrides slot 0.
- The method-definition special form left the compiler, and about 100 lines with
  it.

### Method temporaries must be declared — `343d776`, 2026-08-18

**Breaking: bodies that relied on implicit locals need `| ... |`.**

Fixes a real defect. Assignment inside a method used to declare a local for any
new name, so a global could not be updated from a method at all, and because the
local was declared before its own initializer was compiled,
`counter := counter:add(#1)` read the fresh nil local and failed with
"nil does not understand 'add'".

- Only parameters and names declared with `| a, b |` are locals. Everything else
  is a global, read or written.
- Only the script's top level may **create** a global, so an undeclared name
  inside a method or block must already exist — a typo is reported instead of
  quietly becoming a variable that looks local.
- Declarations may open any group or block body. A duplicate name in one frame is
  a compile error.

### Documented what verification does not promise — `be7fdca`, 2026-08-18

Verification guarantees a loaded chunk is safe to execute; it does not guarantee
the program terminates, and it should not. Established by fuzzing rather than
assumed: every hang seen while corrupting a `.sob` mapped to a constant payload
or code byte, never to a name, count, or length the loader parses, and a control
run over a program with no loop produced zero hangs.

### Blocks, booleans, and message-based control flow — `284d015`, 2026-08-18

**`.sob` went to version 3.**

```
#5:lessThan(#10):ifElse({ #100:print }, { #200:print }).
{ i:lessThan(#5) }:whileTrue({ i := i:add(#1) }).
```

- `{ ... }` makes a block: code as a value, deferred rather than run.
- Control flow is ordinary message sending. `ifTrue`, `ifElse`, and `whileTrue`
  are plain primitives receiving an unevaluated block, so **the language has no
  control-flow syntax** and a user can add control structures the same way.
- The interpreter became re-entrant so a primitive can invoke a block.
- Added a boolean type with `true`/`false` and `not`, and `equals`, `lessThan`,
  `greaterThan` on numbers. Comparisons are as strict as arithmetic; `equals` is
  the exception, answering false across types rather than erroring.
- Capture is lexical, with two cheap measures instead of heap promotion: a block
  that does not touch its home frame may escape freely, and one that does records
  a frame id so calling it after that frame returned is reported.
- With conditionals, recursion can terminate — the language became
  Turing-complete.

### Methods, call frames, and locals — `dd31244`, 2026-08-18

**`.sob` went to version 2.**

Methods could be written in Solum source rather than only as C primitives, and
the VM grew call frames. A frame's slots point into the value stack at the
receiver, so nothing is copied to make a call. Solis began retaining every line's
chunk, because a class holds only a pointer to a method the chunk owns.

### The `.sob` bytecode file format — `2b2bea2`, 2026-08-18

Solas writes bytecode to a file and Solum loads and runs it. Little-endian and
host-independent; floats survive bit-identical; line numbers are run-length
encoded.

A `.sob` file is treated as untrusted input: the loader bounds-checks every read
and rejects a count that could not fit in the bytes remaining, and what survives
is verified before it can execute — every instruction fits, every operand indexes
something real, and the final instruction stops the machine so the dispatch loop
cannot run off the buffer.

### Initial commit — `52f2f01`, 2026-08-18

Solas (compiler), Solum (VM), and Solis (REPL) as three components sharing one
static library, with `solum/include/solum/bytecode.h` as the single contract
between compiler and VM.

Design decisions taken here: a name is a binding rather than an object and values
are immutable; `#` is a type tag, so `#45` is an integer and a bare `45` is a
float; arithmetic is strict and integer overflow traps rather than wrapping.
